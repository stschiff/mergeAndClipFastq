This repository contains some programs that I use for processing sequencing data. To install,
download stack (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) and run "stack install".
If you don't have the Haskell compiler installed, it will tell you to run "stack setup". Please do so.
The stack installations won't interfere with a system-wide installation. If everything goes as planned,
you should end up having the executables defined in this package under ~/.local/bin.

To get help on using the tool, type `mergeAndClipFastq -h`. This should tell you all the options.
